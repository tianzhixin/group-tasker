  description: |
    The Group Tasker API API ("the API") allows users to create and schedule their own activities and track the completion dates.

    The API uses the RESTful architectural style.
    
    ### Error Responses
    
    Errors are communicated by way of an appropriate HTTP status code.
    In the event of an error, where possible, the response body will contain a problem definition conforming to [RFC 7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807).
    
    To resolve an error, a client application should first examine the HTTP status code.

    If additional information is required to handle the error and the response content type is `application/problem+json`, the client application should examine the value of the
    response problem's `type` field.

    Finally, if the problem's `type` indicates that a custom problem object exists, the client application
    may extract additional information from the problem object.
